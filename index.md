# My 3 Favorite Labs
# Angel Saucedo's Portfolio

## Inormation about myself

* My name is Angel Saucedo, I am a first generation college student currently majoring in computer engineering. I am 
interested in technolgy, video games, and general science and animals. I hope to have a successful career as a computer
engineer or a similar job in a similar field. 


## Lab #1.

*One of my favorite labs from this semester was lab 1. I liked Lab 1 because it was our first real introduction to the world of coding. 
I liked how it taught us how to access and clone repositories from github, and was one of the most important labs in helping me understand the future labs.

## Lab #4.

*Another one of my favorite labs from this semester was lab 4. I liked this lab because it used many fucntions to convert
certain units of measurement to a different unit of measurement. I felt like this was really interesting and helpful to learn 
since we will be converting different values/units in many upcoming labs.

## Lab #7

*My third favorite lab from this semester was probably lab 7. I liked lab 7 because this was one of the labs where I got to put a lot of what 
I learned in my lecture classes and my previous labs to the test. I was able to create working functions, which were a pretty big improvement 
from anything I had worked on previously, and it was one of the first labs where I truly felt like a decent programmer.
