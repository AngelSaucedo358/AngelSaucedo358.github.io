# My 3 Favorite Labs
# Angel Saucedo's Portfolio

## Information about myself

* My name is Angel Saucedo, I am a computer engineering major at CSUF and plan on graduating 
in 2028. I am interested in technology, video games, and general science and animals. I hope to have 
a successful career as a computer engineer or a similar job in a similar field.

## Lab #1.

* One of my favorite labs from this semester was lab 1. I liked Lab 1 because it was our first real introduction to the world of coding. 
I liked how it taught us how to access and clone repositories from github, and was one of the most important labs in helping me 
understand the future labs. As someone who would hear about github every now and then, I found it really cool to actually learn 
about and use it on a regular basis.

## Lab #4.

* Another one of my favorite labs from this semester was lab 4 part 1. I liked this lab because it taught us about 
many different functions to convert certain units of measurement to a different unit of measurement. I felt 
like this was really interesting and helpful to learn since we will be converting different values/units 
in many upcoming labs and projects. As someone who likes science, I found it fun to work with these units to find 
the properties of different items.

## Lab #7

* My third favorite lab from this semester was probably lab 7. I liked lab 7 because this was one of the labs
 where I got to put a lot of what I learned in my lecture classes and my previous labs to the test. I was 
 taught how to create working functions, which were a pretty big improvement from anything I had worked on 
 previously, and it was one of the first labs where I truly felt like a decent programmer.
